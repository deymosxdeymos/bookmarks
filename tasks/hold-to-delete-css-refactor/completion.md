# Completion: Hold-to-Delete CSS Refactor

## Summary
- Replaced JS-driven progress overlay with CSS clip-path hold interaction in `components/dashboard/category-combobox.tsx`.
- Added `category-combobox.module.css` to mirror animations-dev styling while keeping existing layout and spacing.
- Updated hold logic to rely on sustained pointer/key press duration (1s) before invoking deletion.
- Ran `bun run lint` to confirm code style integrity.

## Testing
- `bun run lint`
