# Research: Login Redirect Loop in Production

## Problem Analysis
User experiences infinite redirect loop between `/login` and `/dashboard` in production only (works fine in development). Network tab shows 307 redirects cycling between these routes.

## Key Findings

### 1. Authentication Flow Components
- **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`): Checks for `better-auth.session_token` cookie to determine authentication status
- **Login Page** (`app/login/page.tsx`): Uses `auth.api.getSession()` server-side to check session
- **Dashboard Page** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`): Also uses `auth.api.getSession()` server-side to check session
- **Auth Client** (`lib/auth-client.ts`): Minimal configuration using `createAuthClient()`

### 2. Current Auth Configuration
```typescript
// lib/auth.ts - Very minimal configuration
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: pool,
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  plugins: [nextCookies()],
});
```

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
The redirect loop occurs because of inconsistent session validation between middleware and pages:

1. **Middleware** checks for `better-auth.session_token` cookie existence/value
2. **Login/Dashboard pages** use `auth.api.getSession()` which validates the actual session
3. In production, there's likely a mismatch where:
   - Cookie exists but session is invalid/expired → middleware thinks authenticated
   - `auth.api.getSession()` returns null → pages redirect accordingly
   - Creates infinite loop

### 4. Production-Specific Issues Identified
Better-auth requires additional configuration for production environments:

- **Missing `baseURL`**: Required for proper cookie domain and auth endpoints
- **Missing `secret`**: Required for session security in production
- **Missing cookie configuration**: Domain, secure flags, etc.
- **Potential CORS issues**: If frontend/backend domains differ

### 5. Environment Differences
- **Development**: Better-auth defaults work with localhost
- **Production**: Requires explicit configuration for deployed environment

### 6. Better-Auth Version
Using `better-auth@^1.3.13` - recent version but configuration incomplete for production

## Next Steps
Need to enhance auth configuration with production-specific settings to ensure consistent session validation across middleware and server-side checks.
