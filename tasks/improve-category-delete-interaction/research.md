# Research: Category Delete Interaction

## Current Implementation Analysis

The category combobox already has a click-and-hold delete mechanism implemented, but the user reports needing to "double click" to delete. This suggests the current interaction isn't working as intended or isn't intuitive enough.

### Current Hold Mechanism

**Duration**: 800ms (HOLD_DURATION_MS)
**Visual Feedback**:
- Progress bar fills from 0% to 100%
- Text changes from "Delete Group" to "Hold to confirm" on hover/focus
- Uses destructive styling (red colors)

**Event Handling**:
- `onPointerDown` starts hold timer
- `onPointerUp`, `onPointerLeave`, `onPointerCancel` cancel hold
- Keyboard support with Space/Enter keys
- Progress animation with easing: `var(--ease-out-quart)`

### Potential Issues

1. **Hold Duration Too Long**: 800ms might feel unresponsive
2. **Visual Feedback Unclear**: Progress bar might not be visible enough
3. **Touch vs Mouse Behavior**: Different behaviors on different devices
4. **Event Conflicts**: Pointer events might conflict with Command component

## Design Guidelines Compliance

### From INTERFACE.md
✅ **Hit Targets**: Delete button should be ≥24px (currently appears adequate)
✅ **Confirm Destructive Actions**: Hold-to-confirm pattern is used
✅ **Keyboard Support**: Space/Enter keys supported
✅ **Accessible**: Has proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
⚠️ **Forgiving Interactions**: 800ms might be too strict

### From ANIMATIONS.md
✅ **Reduced Motion**: `reducedMotionRef` respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
✅ **Easing**: Uses `var(--ease-out-quart)`
✅ **Performance**: Uses `transform` and `requestAnimationFrame`
⚠️ **Duration**: 800ms is longer than recommended 200-300ms for UI feedback

## User Experience Patterns

### Industry Standards
- **iOS**: Long press typically 500-750ms
- **Android**: Long press ~500ms
- **Web**: Hold-to-confirm usually 300-600ms

### Best Practices
- Provide immediate visual feedback (within 100ms)
- Clear progress indication
- Easy escape mechanism
- Appropriate feedback sounds/haptics (if available)

## Existing Codebase Patterns

Need to search for other delete/destructive actions in the codebase to maintain consistency:
- Look for other hold-to-delete implementations
- Check if there are other confirmation patterns
- Verify consistent timing across interactions

## Potential Improvements

1. **Reduce Hold Duration**: From 800ms to 500-600ms
2. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**:
   - More prominent progress indicator
   - Better color contrast
   - Smoother animations
3. **Improved Touch Handling**:
   - Better mobile responsiveness
   - Handle touch vs mouse differences
4. **Accessibility**:
   - Screen reader announcements
   - Better keyboard navigation
5. **Alternative Patterns**:
   - Two-step confirmation (click → confirm)
   - Undo mechanism after deletion

## Questions for Implementation

1. Should we maintain hold-to-delete or switch to click → confirm dialog?
2. What's the optimal hold duration for this use case?
3. Should we add sound/haptic feedback for better UX?
4. How do we handle edge cases (network delays, rapid interactions)?
