# Performance Audit Research Findings

## useEffect Violations Found

After scanning the codebase, I found several files using useEffect. Here's my analysis:

### Legitimate useEffect Usage (External System Sync)

1. **login-form.tsx:45** - ‚úÖ VALID
   - Syncing with `beforeunload` browser event
   - Properly cleaning up event listener
   - This is exactly what useEffect should be used for

2. **error.tsx:9** - ‚úÖ VALID
   - Console error logging (external system)
   - Standard error boundary pattern

3. **loading-bar.tsx:17,34** - ‚úÖ VALID
   - Managing animation timers (external system)
   - Proper cleanup of timers

4. **text-entrance-animation.tsx:20** - ‚úÖ VALID
   - Managing animation timers for text effects
   - External system synchronization

5. **bookmarks-section.tsx:38,319** - ‚úÖ VALID
   - Document-level keyboard event listeners (external system)
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners
   - Managing refs for current state

### Potentially Problematic useEffect Usage

6. **sign-up-form.tsx:56** - ‚ùì NEEDS REVIEW
   - Similar beforeunload pattern to login-form
   - Need to verify if this is just for navigation warning

7. **primary-input.tsx:38,49** - ‚ùì NEEDS REVIEW
   - Two useEffect calls - might be over-reactive
   - Could potentially be derived state

8. **category-combobox.tsx:154,160,168,178,180** - üî¥ POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS
   - FIVE useEffect calls in one component
   - Some might be derivable state or could use refs
   - Effects: focus management, open state reset, media query, cleanup, keyboard handlers

## Performance Anti-Patterns Found

1. **Excessive useEffect in category-combobox.tsx** - 5 effects in one component
2. **Multiple state updates in same component** - Could cause unnecessary re-renders
3. **No usage of useMemo/useCallback where appropriate** in some components
4. **Potential over-reactive effects** that could be replaced with derived values

## Code Style Violations per CLAUDE.md

1. **Inline comments found** - CLAUDE.md says "do not add useless comments"
2. **Some useState usage** that could be replaced with useRef for non-reactive values
3. **Complex conditional rendering** that could be extracted to components

## Libraries in Use

- React Query ‚úÖ - Properly used for data fetching
- No fetch in useEffect found ‚úÖ
- Proper form handling with React Hook Form ‚úÖ
- Good use of Zod validation ‚úÖ

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Refactor category-combobox.tsx to reduce useEffect count
2. **Medium Priority**: Review primary-input.tsx effects
3. **Low Priority**: Clean up any unnecessary comments
4. **Low Priority**: Convert some useState to useRef where reactive updates aren't needed
