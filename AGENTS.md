# AI Agent Guidelines - Bookmarks

## Commands

- **Build:** `bun run build` (uses Next.js with turbopack)
- **Lint:** `bun run lint` (Biome)
- **Type Check:** `bun run check`
- **Format:** `bun run format` or `bun run fix`
- **Dev:** `bun dev`

## Code Style

- **Formatting:** Biome with tab indentation, double quotes
- **Imports:** Use `@/` alias, auto-organize imports
- **Types:** Strict TypeScript, explicit for complex objects
- **Naming:** camelCase vars/functions, PascalCase components, kebab-case files
- **Components:** Server Components by default, `"use client"` only for
  interactivity

## Next.js Patterns

- Server Components for data fetching, Client Components for state/interactivity
- Use proper loading.tsx, error.tsx boundaries
- Implement Suspense for async components
- Use Zod for validation, shadcn/ui for components
- Treat UIs as a thin layer over your data. Skip local state (like useState)
  unless itâ€™s absolutely needed and clearly separate from business logic. Choose
  variables and useRef if it doesn't need to be reactive.
- When you find yourself with nested if/else or complex conditional rendering,
  create a new component. Reserve inline ternaries for tiny, readable sections.
- Choose to derive data rather than use useEffect. Only use useEffect when you
  need to syncronize with an external system (e.g. document-level events). It
  causes misdirection of what the logic is going. Choose to explicitly define
  logic rather than depend on implicit reactive behavior
- Treat setTimeout as a last resort (and always comment why)
- IMPORTANT: do not add useless comments. avoid adding comments unless you're
  clarifying a race condition (setTimeout), a long-term TODO, or clarifying a
  confusing piece of code even a senior engineer wouldn't initially understand.

## Key Libraries

- UI: shadcn/ui with Radix, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Utils: clsx/cn for conditional classes, next-themes for dark mode
- Database: Supabase
