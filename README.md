# Bookmark, inspired by bmrks by rauno

Trying to build a minimal bookmark app for for personal usage, designed with personal preferences. Bare-featured, minimal boring interface. Auto-detect input content type. Render links with page metadata. Keyboard-first design. Animated appropriately. Loads fast (citation needed). No onboarding. No tracking. No ads, ever.

The point of this is no fancy-ass interactions, make it responsive strive to be more like a terminal app response wise. Keyboard centric, all things have command for them.


Tools:
